# ManualRotation
Inspired by Samsung OneUI manual rotation.

## Philosophy 
This program is designed to be as stealthy and simple as possible, designed to be forgotten once set up. It even doesn't have any kind of configuration other than registering for startup. 

## Usage 
Once installed and running, if Auto Rotate is disengaged and the device rotated to another direction, a notification toast will pop out like this:

Tap the `Rotate` button to rotate the screen. Tap elsewhere or swipe to the side to dismiss the notification. 

## Installation
Currently there's no installer available. A manual installation is possible by copying files to `%LOCALAPPDATA%/Programs/ManualRotation` and run `ManualRotation.exe install` to register for startup. Similarly, uninstallation is as simple as run `ManualRotation.exe remove` and delete the files.
